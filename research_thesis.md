### Text

To effectively add a temporal dimension to OWL ontologies, several approaches and methodologies have been proposed in the literature, focusing on both qualitative and quantitative representations of temporal information.

One prominent method is the utilization of the τOWL (Temporal OWL 2) framework, which structures temporal management within OWL ontologies. This framework enables the creation of temporal OWL ontologies from traditional OWL versions through a combination of logical and physical annotations. Logical annotations identify the components of the ontology that are subject to temporal variation, while physical annotations provide guidelines on how to represent these variations in the OWL document (Zekri et al., 2016). Such a structured approach is essential for maintaining consistency and integrity in temporal representations.

Additionally, qualitative temporal relations are addressed through methodologies that define ternary relationships involving objects, time points, and attributes. A common resolution to this challenge involves transforming these ternary relationships into binary relationships by introducing intermediate classes, thus allowing OWL to effectively manage temporal information despite its inherent limitations (Preventis et al., 2014). Tools like CHRONOS Ed, designed for handling temporal ontologies, exemplify this approach by supporting the dynamic representation of temporal knowledge (Preventis et al., 2014).

Another vital aspect is the acquisition of temporal conceptual modeling through Temporal Description Logic (TQL), which extends OWL to accommodate temporal aspects while maintaining first-order compatibility for important query capabilities (Artale et al., 2013). This enables ontology-based data access over temporal data and supports rich query formulations and reasoning mechanisms that integrate time expressions directly into the ontology's structure.

Moreover, the exploration of fuzzy temporal dimensions is represented in frameworks like FT-SWRL, which combines fuzzy logic with temporal modeling to capture imprecise temporal knowledge. Such an approach allows the representation of uncertainty in temporal data, which is crucial for applications requiring nuanced decision-making processes (Lawan & Rakib, 2019).

The integration of spatio-temporal elements has also been extensively discussed, particularly through systems like SOWL QL that enhance querying capabilities over both spatial and temporal data using natural language expressions. This facilitates more intuitive interactions when working with complex temporal queries (Stravoskoufos et al., 2016). Furthermore, the establishment of temporal operators within OWL promotes advanced reasoning capabilities, allowing users to assert temporal relationships similar to the facilities provided in relational databases (Fang et al., 2014).

In summary, incorporating a temporal dimension into OWL ontologies can be achieved through several interconnected strategies. The development of specialized frameworks like τOWL, the application of temporal description logics, and the use of reasoning extensions tailored for fuzzy and spatio-temporal data significantly enhance OWL's capability to model and query temporal information effectively. This multi-faceted approach ensures that ontologies not only represent present knowledge but also accommodate changes over time, thus providing a robust foundation for temporal data semantics in various domains.

Introduction

The integration of a temporal dimension into OWL ontologies presents a significant challenge and an active area of research, primarily due to OWL's inherent limitations in modeling dynamic information and its lack of native temporal constructs Mefteh_2013. 

Unlike relational databases that adopt a Closed World Assumption and primarily use binary relationships, OWL's semantics are not directly equivalent to Entity-Relationship models, complicating the representation of time-indexed data Batsakis_Petrakis_2012. 

This disparity necessitates novel approaches to embed temporal reasoning within semantic web technologies, moving beyond static knowledge representation to capture the evolving nature of real-world phenomena Harbelot_Arenas_Cruz_2013. This is particularly crucial given that temporality is a fundamental aspect of diverse data models, where both historical and current content often hold critical significance Wang_Tansel_Tansel_Tansel_2019. 

Existing methodologies for incorporating time into OWL ontologies often involve extensions like OWL-Time, which defines temporal concepts such as instants and intervals, though it lacks domain-specific temporal definitions Vaatz_Hamdan_Al-Sadoon_Wogan_Menzel_2023. 

Literature Review

Further investigation reveals that while some approaches extend RDF with validity time, allowing explicit management of temporal aspects, they often fall short of OWL's full expressiveness, for instance, by not supporting qualitative relations Harbelot_Arenas_Cruz_2013. Despite these advancements, a comprehensive and universally accepted framework for handling temporal aspects in OWL ontologies remains elusive, prompting diverse strategies to address the challenge of representing knowledge that evolves over time Giustozzi_2020 Wang_Tansel_Tansel_Tansel_2019.

Introduction: Temporal Representation in Semantic Web and OWL Ontologies
Temporal information representation has emerged as a central research focus in knowledge representation, databases, and the Semantic Web, addressing the fundamental challenge of representing concepts and entities that evolve over time within formal ontology structures Batsakis_Petrakis_Tachmazidis_Antoniou_2017. Traditional static ontologies fail to capture the dynamic nature of real-world phenomena, where properties, relationships, and entity states change across temporal dimensions. This gap between static ontological frameworks and the temporal complexity of knowledge necessitates extended approaches that integrate time-awareness into semantic representations.

OWL (Web Ontology Language) provides a robust foundation for Semantic Web ontologies through its description logic formalism, yet it requires significant extensions to adequately capture temporal dimensions Batsakis_Petrakis_Tachmazidis_Antoniou_2017. Standard OWL lacks native constructs for representing dynamic information, time intervals, and qualitative temporal relationships, forcing developers to implement workarounds through external mechanisms. The challenge is compounded by the need to maintain logical soundness while representing temporal constraints, as traditional OWL reasoning assumes a static universe of discourse. Consequently, researchers have developed auxiliary languages and formal extensions, including the use of SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) rules and N-ary relations, to bridge this representational gap while preserving computational tractability.

Two complementary approaches have emerged for temporal representation within OWL frameworks. Quantitative temporal information captures precise temporal knowledge through specific dates, time instants, and defined intervals, providing exact chronological positioning. Conversely, qualitative temporal information employs natural language expressions such as 'before,' 'after,' and 'during' to represent temporal relationships when exact boundaries remain unknown Batsakis_Petrakis_Tachmazidis_Antoniou_2017. These approaches often employ 4D-fluents or N-ary relation mechanisms, each offering distinct advantages: 4D-fluents treat temporal intervals as explicit entities in the ontology, while N-ary relations enable more flexible representation of time-dependent properties. The integration of temporal reasoning with ontological frameworks enables systems to handle complex time-dependent knowledge, including entity property evolution and state transitions Mas_2010, achieved through path consistency algorithms and SWRL-based reasoning procedures that maintain tractability across large temporal knowledge bases.

Applications demanding temporal ontologies span multiple critical domains: geographic information systems and spatiotemporal databases leverage temporal ontologies for representing evolving spatial phenomena Cheng_Yan_Ma_Ribaric_2019, while digital rights management and policy enforcement systems employ temporal dimensions to manage expiration dates, deadlines, and activation events for permissions and obligations Fornara_Colombetti_2019. The breadth of these applications demonstrates that temporal reasoning is not merely an academic pursuit but rather an essential capability for knowledge systems operating in real-world environments where time constitutes a fundamental dimension of information structure and interpretation.

Representation Mechanisms for Temporal Information in OWL
OWL temporal representation employs three primary mechanisms, each with distinct computational and ontological trade-offs. The 4D-fluents approach represents temporal dynamics by treating temporal slices of concepts as first-class entities, allowing properties to change across time dimensions Batsakis_Petrakis_Tachmazidis_Antoniou_2017. Each time slice constitutes a separate object with its own properties, enabling explicit modeling of how object attributes evolve from one temporal state to another. This mechanism proves particularly effective for applications requiring precise tracking of entity property evolution, such as version control systems and genealogical reconstruction in biomedical data Burek_Scherf_Herre_2019. Conversely, the N-ary relations mechanism provides an alternative by introducing auxiliary entities that capture temporal context alongside traditional binary relationships Batsakis_Petrakis_Tachmazidis_Antoniou_2017. Rather than multiplying entity instances across time, N-ary relations maintain the original entity while adding temporal parameters through reified relationships, facilitating integration into OWL's RDF/XML serialization. This approach demonstrates superior scalability in scenarios with sparse temporal annotations, avoiding the combinatorial explosion of temporal slices inherent to the 4D-fluents approach.

Temporal specifications within OWL employ two complementary information types. Quantitative temporal information utilizes precise time specifications including absolute dates, time instants, and defined intervals Batsakis_Petrakis_Tachmazidis_Antoniou_2017, supporting exact temporal queries and constraint-based reasoning over well-defined timepoints through interval algebra and path consistency algorithms. Qualitative temporal information, conversely, incorporates natural language expressions and relative temporal relationships when exact durations or precise temporal boundaries are unknown or impractical to specify Batsakis_Petrakis_Tachmazidis_Antoniou_2017. Qualitative temporal reasoning is realized through sets of SWRL rules and OWL axioms implementing sound, complete, and tractable reasoning procedures based on path consistency applied across existing relation sets. This dual-information approach enables systems to represent both precise historical data and vague or uncertain temporal knowledge simultaneously.

Fuzzy spatiotemporal ontologies extend OWL beyond these classical mechanisms through fuzzy description logic, introducing a fuzzy spatiotemporal web ontology language that combines uncertainty with temporal dimensions Cheng_Yan_Ma_Ribaric_2019. This extension supports reasoning about imprecise spatial and temporal knowledge, critical for geographic information systems and other domains where both spatial boundaries and temporal relationships contain inherent fuzziness. Fuzzy extensions enable graduated membership transitions across temporal intervals rather than crisp temporal boundaries, accommodating real-world phenomena that evolve gradually rather than discretely. The integration of fuzzy membership functions with temporal reasoning provides formal foundations for handling subjective temporal expressions and spatiotemporal knowledge with inherent vagueness.

Temporal Reasoning and Inference Strategies
Temporal reasoning in OWL extends beyond static ontological structures through formalized inference procedures that derive implicit temporal knowledge from explicit declarations. Qualitative temporal reasoning employs SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) rules combined with OWL axioms to formalize temporal relationships Batsakis_Petrakis_Tachmazidis_Antoniou_2017. This approach leverages Allen's interval relations as a foundational framework, where path consistency algorithms applied across interval sets establish a sound, complete, and tractable reasoning procedure. By encoding temporal constraints through SWRL rules—such as rules specifying that if event A occurs before event B, and B occurs before event C, then A occurs before C—systems can systematically propagate temporal knowledge across ontological assertions. The computational properties of this approach ensure that reasoning remains decidable even in large temporal knowledge bases, addressing a critical concern in knowledge representation where inference procedures must terminate within practical timeframes.

Temporal constraint propagation mechanisms enable systems to maintain consistency across temporal assertions and derive implicit temporal relationships from explicit declarations Batsakis_Petrakis_Tachmazidis_Antoniou_2017. These mechanisms function by iteratively applying temporal constraints until a fixed point is reached, ensuring that all derivable temporal facts are made explicit. When a system encounters contradictions—for instance, discovering that an interval is simultaneously before and overlaps with another interval—constraint propagation identifies inconsistencies and prevents inconsistent knowledge base states. This capability proves essential for long-running systems where temporal assertions accumulate incrementally and consistency maintenance becomes computationally expensive. Furthermore, constraint propagation enables systems to answer queries like "What is the latest possible start time for event E given current temporal constraints?" by computing tightest temporal bounds across constraint networks.

Advanced temporal reasoning extends beyond classical interval algebra to accommodate uncertainty and dynamic updating. Multi-entity Bayesian networks integrated with SWRL rules handle uncertain temporal information and dynamic ontology updating under both exogenous (external) and endogenous (internal) semantic changes Mas_2010. This probabilistic approach assigns confidence scores to temporal assertions, enabling systems to reason under incomplete information where exact temporal boundaries remain unknown or assertions carry associated uncertainty weights. When external information arrives (exogenous updating) or when reasoning internally derives new temporal constraints (endogenous updating), the integrated framework updates belief distributions across the ontology while maintaining probabilistic consistency. Such mechanisms prove invaluable for knowledge bases harvested from multiple sources with varying reliability or for domains where temporal knowledge evolves incrementally.

Event-based temporal semantics support complex temporal patterns by representing events with activation conditions, temporal validity periods, and consequences Fornara_Colombetti_2019. Rather than treating events as instantaneous points on a timeline, this approach encodes rich temporal structure: an event may have preconditions that must hold before activation, a temporal window during which the event remains valid, and postconditions that become true upon event completion. This representation enables systems to monitor policy compliance by tracking whether required actions occur within specified temporal windows and to enforce permissions or prohibitions that apply during particular temporal intervals. For example, a digital rights management system can encode that a license grants viewing permissions during a specific temporal interval, with monitoring mechanisms ensuring that content access requests occur within that validity period and triggering obligations upon expiration. Ontology evolution frameworks track temporal changes at both schema and instance levels, supporting version management and temporal knowledge base consistency Mas_2010. These frameworks maintain explicit records of when ontological statements were asserted, modified, or retracted, enabling temporal queries about knowledge base evolution. Schema-level tracking records changes to class hierarchies and property definitions, while instance-level tracking captures when individual assertions entered or exited the knowledge base, supporting auditing and temporal knowledge reconstruction.

Key Temporal Reasoning Capabilities Enabled by OWL Extensions
Constraint Propagation: Automatically derives implicit temporal relationships from explicit assertions through iterative constraint satisfaction, maintaining consistency across complex temporal networks and enabling efficient identification of contradictions within temporal specifications.

Interval Algebra: Implements Allen's thirteen temporal relations (before, after, during, overlaps, meets, etc.) through formal axiomatization in OWL and SWRL, enabling precise reasoning about temporal relationships between events and intervals with computational decidability guarantees.

Event Sequencing: Supports ordered representation of complex multi-step temporal patterns by encoding prerequisite relationships, temporal ordering constraints, and causal dependencies between events, enabling systems to reason about valid execution sequences and temporal causality.

Uncertainty Handling: Integrates probabilistic reasoning through Bayesian networks and fuzzy membership functions, allowing systems to reason over temporal assertions with confidence scores and managing inconsistent temporal information from heterogeneous sources while maintaining principled probabilistic semantics.

Applications, Challenges, and Future Research Directions
Geographic information systems (GIS) and spatiotemporal databases represent foundational applications for temporal OWL ontologies, leveraging these frameworks to model evolving spatial phenomena with formal semantic constraints Cheng_Yan_Ma_Ribaric_2019. These systems require representation of object trajectories, spatial property changes across temporal intervals, and complex spatiotemporal queries answering questions about when objects occupied particular locations, how spatial relationships evolved, and what transformations occurred during specified time periods. Temporal ontologies enable GIS applications to maintain version histories of geographic features, track land use changes across decades, and support reasoning about historical spatial configurations. The integration of fuzzy spatiotemporal reasoning further enhances GIS capabilities by accommodating inherent uncertainty in both spatial boundaries and temporal extent, critical for phenomena like coastline migration or atmospheric phenomena where sharp temporal demarcations are inappropriate.

Digital rights management (DRM) and policy enforcement systems constitute another critical application domain where temporal ontologies specify time-dependent permissions, obligations, and prohibitions with explicit expiration dates and deadline constraints Fornara_Colombetti_2019. These systems encode complex temporal semantics: a license may grant viewing permissions during a specific validity interval, with additional obligations to generate audit logs during that period and automatic deactivation upon expiration. Rights ontologies track when permissions become active, their duration constraints, and postconditions triggered upon termination, enabling automated compliance monitoring and enforcement. ODRL 2.2 (Open Digital Rights Language) standards formalize temporal aspects of obligations, permissions, and prohibitions using Semantic Web technologies, supporting application-independent operational semantics computed through production rule systems that track policy evolution as events occur and temporal boundaries pass.

Engineering model integration systems employ temporal ontologies to maintain authoritative data sources across multi-domain tool environments spanning CAD, simulation, analysis, and manufacturing systems Dunbar_Hagedorn_Blackburn_Dzielski_Hespelt_Kruse_Verma_Yu_2022. These frameworks enable temporal synchronization of model changes, supporting queries about design evolution, change propagation tracking, and temporal reconstruction of design decisions. The digital engineering framework for integration and interoperability (DEFII) utilizes semantic web technologies to create tool-agnostic representations of engineering data with explicit temporal lineage, enabling multiple stakeholders across disciplinary boundaries to access consistent temporal views of evolving system models. This temporal integration proves essential when engineering designs undergo iterative refinement, requiring systems to track when specifications changed, which changes propagated to dependent components, and how temporal constraints influenced design evolution.

Despite these applications, significant computational challenges limit temporal ontology deployment at scale. Computational complexity remains problematic, particularly for large-scale temporal reasoning with numerous temporal constraints and uncertain information Mas_2010. Path consistency algorithms fundamental to qualitative temporal reasoning exhibit polynomial complexity in bounded temporal domains but become computationally expensive as constraint networks grow, especially when combined with uncertain information requiring probabilistic inference. Managing exogenous (external information arrival) and endogenous (internally derived) semantic updating introduces additional computational demands when systems must dynamically revise temporal beliefs while maintaining ontological consistency. Balancing expressiveness with tractability requires careful algorithm design, leveraging techniques like incremental constraint propagation and selective reasoning activation to avoid exhaustive inference across entire temporal knowledge bases.

Future research directions address multiple interconnected challenges requiring coordinated investigation Batsakis_Petrakis_Tachmazidis_Antoniou_2017. Developing more expressive temporal logics compatible with standard OWL while maintaining decidability remains an active research frontier, potentially through extensions supporting branching time, continuous time models, or hybrid discrete-continuous temporal representations. Improving scalability of temporal reasoning engines requires investigation of distributed reasoning architectures, caching strategies for temporal inferences, and optimization of interval algebra implementations. Standardizing temporal ontology design patterns for domain-specific applications would accelerate adoption by providing reusable solutions addressing common temporal representation problems in healthcare, finance, supply chains, and other domains. Additionally, integrating temporal reasoning with machine learning approaches could enable systems to infer temporal patterns from historical data and predict future temporal evolution, combining formal semantic guarantees with data-driven pattern discovery.

The proposed approach extends the existing framework of representing temporal information in ontologies by allowing for representation of concepts evolving in time (referred to as dynamic information) and of their properties in terms of qualitative descriptions in addition to quantitative ones (i.e., dates, time instants and intervals). For this purpose, we advocate the use of natural language expressions, such as before or after, for temporal entities whose exact durations or starting and ending points in time are unknown. Reasoning over all types of temporal information (such as the above) is also an important research problem. The current work addresses all these issues as follows: The representation of dynamic concepts is achieved using the 4D-fluents or, alternatively, the N-ary relations mechanism. Both mechanisms are thoroughly explored and are expanded for representing qualitative and quantitative temporal information in OWL. In turn, temporal information is expressed using either intervals or time instants. Qualitative temporal information representation in particular, is realized using sets of SWRL rules and OWL axioms leading to a sound, complete and tractable reasoning procedure based on path consistency applied on the existing relation sets. Building upon existing Semantic Web standards (OWL), tools and member submissions (SWRL), as well as integrating temporal reasoning support into the proposed representation, are important design features of our approach.}, journal={None}, author={Batsakis, Sotiris and Petrakis, E. and Tachmazidis, Ilias and Antoniou, G.}, year={2017}, month=aug }

Ontology, as a formal method of knowledge representation, plays a key role in the Semantic Web. Therefore, how to extend ontologies to represent fuzzy spatiotemporal knowledge needs to be solved. In this paper, we propose an approach for representing fuzzy spatiotemporal knowledge with ontologies and investigate a formal construction of fuzzy spatiotemporal ontologies based on fuzzy Petri nets. First, we propose a formal definition of fuzzy spatiotemporal ontologies. In addition, based on fuzzy description logic, a description logic named the fuzzy spatiotemporal description logic, which provides a logical basis for the fuzzy spatiotemporal ontologies, is presented. Furthermore, a fuzzy spatiotemporal web ontology language, which is fuzzy and spatiotemporal extension of standard ontology language OWL, is proposed to make the fuzzy spatiotemporal ontologies easy to use and support efficient reasoning. On the basis of fuzzy spatiotemporal ontologies, we investigate a formal approach for constructing fuzzy spatiotemporal ontologies from fuzzy spatiotemporal Petri nets, ie, transforming fuzzy spatiotemporal Petri nets (including Petri net model and Petri net instance) into fuzzy spatiotemporal ontologies at both structure and instance levels. Finally, we prove the correctness of the transformation and provide a detailed transformation example.}, journal={International Conference on Climate Informatics}, author={Cheng, Haitao and Yan, Li and Ma, Zongmin and Ribaric, S.}, year={2019}, month=jan }

ODRL 2.2 (Open Digital Right Language) is a W3C standard policy expression language formalized using Semantic Web technologies. It is used to represent permitted and prohibited actions over a certain asset, and obligations required to be met by parties involved in the exchange of a digital asset. In this paper, we propose to extend the model of obligation, permission, and prohibition proposed by ODRL 2.2 in two directions. Firstly, by inserting in the model the notion of activation event (or action) and by expressing event and action as complex constructs having types and application-independent properties. Secondly, by considering the temporal aspects of obligations, permissions, and prohibitions (e.g. expiration dates and deadlines) as part of their application independent model. These extensions are necessary in order to be able to propose an application-independent operational semantics of the extended model, which is formalized using State Machines and is computed by a specific production rule system. The proposed approach has been tested by developing a framework in Java able to get as input a set of policies formalized using Semantic Web languages, and to compute their evolution in time based on the events and actions that happen in the interaction among the parties involved in the specified policies.}, journal={AI Communications}, author={Fornara, Nicoletta and Colombetti, M.}, year={2019}, month=aug }

The goal is the reconstruction of cell migration patterns, shape and state changes, and, comprehensive genealogical information from these data. This information can be used to develop process models of cellular dynamics. However, so far there has been no structured, standardized way of annotating and storing the tracking results, which is critical for comparative analysis and data integration. The key requirement to be satisfied by an ontology is the representation of a cells change over time. Unfortunately, popular ontology languages, such as Web Ontology Language (OWL), have limitations for the representation of temporal information. The current paper addresses the fundamental problem of modeling changes of qualities over time in biomedical ontologies specified in OWL. The presented analysis is a result of the lessons learned during the development of an ontology, intended for the annotation of cell tracking experiments. We present, discuss and evaluate various representation patterns for specifying cell changes in time. In particular, we discuss two patterns of temporally changing information: n-ary relation reification and 4d fluents. These representation schemes are formalized within the ontology language OWL and are aimed at the support for annotation of cell tracking experiments. We analyze the performance of each pattern with respect to standard criteria used in software engineering and data modeling, i.e. simplicity, scalability, extensibility and adequacy. We further discuss benefits, drawbacks, and the underlying design choices of each approach. We demonstrate that patterns perform differently depending on the temporal distribution of modeled information. The optimal model can be constructed by combining two competitive approaches. Thus, we demonstrate that both reification and 4d fluents patterns can work hand in hand in a single ontology. Additionally, we have found that 4d fluents can be reconstructed by two patterns well known in the computer science community, i.e. state modeling and actor-role pattern.}, journal={Journal of Biomedical Semantics}, author={Burek, P. and Scherf, Nico and Herre, H.}, year={2019}, month=oct }
